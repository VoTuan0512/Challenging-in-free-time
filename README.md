  In challenge 1 and 2, I used some basic query techniques like CTE, join, having, pagination,.. and functions to answer questions are:
  * Date and time functions (datediff)
  * Window functions (dense_rank, lag, percentile_disc, window frame)
  * Aggregate functions (sum, count, min, max)
  * Set operations (union, except)
  * String functions (cast)
  * Mathematical functions (round, sqrt)
